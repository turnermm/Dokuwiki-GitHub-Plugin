The plugin requires the sqlite plugin.  

It is a working version, but possibly useable.

In its current state it has an administrative panel which enables the user to create a database
of commits from a git specified in a hard-coded path in helper.php, both in the function _getDB() 
and in the constructor.  This will eventually be upgraded to something  more convenient.

In its present from it can be queried from the sqlite plugin admin panel.

The initial imetus behind this plugin is to help determine recent changes to Dokuiwiki
which might impact on plugin authors, so that they can get advance warning.
