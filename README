The plugin requires the sqlite plugin.  

It also requires an intial git, the path to which is set in in the Dokuwiki
Configuration Manager 

It has an administrative panel which enables the user to create databases of
commits from gits specified in the configuration manager and in a config file
named default.local.ini, located in the conf directory. This file contains an
explanation of how to set up the configuration. The gits must be fully readable
by the web server, including their .git directories.


The databases created by this plugin can be queried from the admin panel and
from a syntax plugin. The HOW-TO is described on the DOkuwiki site for this
plugin: http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:dwcommits 

Please read the documentation in the admin panel or on the plugin web site
concerning web server access.

The initial impetus behind this plugin is to help determine recent changes to
Dokuwiki which might impact on plugin authors.
